# MapReduce

A lecture on MapReduce with code examples.

This lecture is part of the course [*Large Scale Data Mining*](http://pharos.l3s.uni-hannover.de:7080/lsdm) by Avishek Anand @ [L3S Research Center](http://www.l3s.de), [Leibniz University of Hannover](http://www.uni-hannover.de).

It is based on the book [*Mining of Massive Datasets*](http://www.mmds.org) by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, Jeff Ullman.
The original slides of the book have not been changed, but re-sorted, some have been omitted and new slides have been added.

This lecture extends the original slides of the book with code examples and a new introduction to the course, starting from imperative programming and transitioning to functional programming to demonstrate the concepts and ideas behind MapReduce.

The slides are linked to the source code files in this repository.
